## 📌 About

When running services inside **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**, accessing them from outside the host machine can be tricky.  
By default, WSL assigns a dynamic IP address on every restart, meaning any static port forwarding rules you set up in Windows using `netsh portproxy` will break after a reboot.

**WSL PortProxy Manager** solves this problem by:
- Automatically detecting the current WSL IP address at startup.
- Allowing you to quickly create, delete, and list Windows `portproxy` rules.
- Giving you a simple GUI instead of typing complex `netsh` commands.
- Ensuring your services (web apps, APIs, SSH, etc.) in WSL are accessible from your Windows host or LAN without manual IP checks.
