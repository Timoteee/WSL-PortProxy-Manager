## 📌 About  
When running services inside WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), accessing them from outside the host machine can be tricky.

By default, WSL assigns a dynamic IP address on every restart, meaning any static port forwarding rules you set up in Windows using `netsh portproxy` will break after a reboot.

**WSL PortProxy Manager** solves this problem by:

- Automatically detecting the current WSL IP address at startup.  
- Allowing you to quickly create, delete, and list Windows portproxy rules.  
- Giving you a simple GUI instead of typing complex `netsh` commands.  
- Ensuring your services (web apps, APIs, SSH, etc.) in WSL are accessible from your Windows host or LAN without manual IP checks.

This tool was born out of frustration as a developer working extensively with WSL and Docker on Windows. Constantly checking WSL IPs, manually crafting `netsh` commands, and debugging broken port forwarding after reboots was tedious. This tool makes port management effortless, saving time and reducing errors in dynamic environments like WSL/Docker setups.

**Command-wise, it wraps `netsh interface portproxy` operations:**

- **Add Rule:** Equivalent to  
  `netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=80 connectaddress=<WSL_IP> connectport=80`  
- **Delete Rule:** Equivalent to  
  `netsh interface portproxy delete v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=80`  
- **Show Rules:** Parses `netsh interface portproxy show all` with added diagnostics (e.g., port open checks).  
- **Docker Port Forwarding:** Automatically creates rules for selected container ports, forwarding Docker's published ports to Windows via WSL IP.
